First Ironhack Game Project

This is a Simon game clone, for one or two players, based on [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MTR3V2XpRI) 


## The Game

Genius was a very popular toy in the 1980s, being a version of Simon from the American manufacturer Hasbro.

In a UFO-like format, it had colored buttons that emitted harmonic sounds and lit in sequence.

It is up to players to repeat the process without making a mistake.
